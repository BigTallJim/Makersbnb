Introduction

This is the week 6 group chanllenge at Makers Academy. The aim of the application is to implement similar functionalities as airbnb.

Instruction
---
To use the application, clone the repositry, run 'npm install'at root of directoty.
To launch the server, run 'npm start' and visit 'localhost:3000'.

***Minimum viable product (MVP)***
The smallest thing that implements the core idea. Think about what this is for Airbnb. Build those user stories first. This MVP will exclude most of the headline specification items in the spec.

If your specification asks for a car, don't build the wheels in the first week, the doors in the second week, etc. The customer can't try it! Instead, build a skateboard in the first week.

Aim to get to your MVP by the end of Tuesday.

***User Stories***
